<h1>Mapping Urban Layout and Future Development in Kalispell, Montana</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we focus on the city of Kalispell in the Flathead Valley of Northwestern Montana, a prime tourist destination near Glacier National Park, Flathead Lake, and other attractions. With a regional population of around 140,000 and over 22,000 within city limits, Kalispell's economy is heavily reliant on tourism and seeks to attract new investments. The core objective is to utilize data from the Flathead County regional database and ArcGIS Pro to create high-quality presentation maps. These maps will illustrate the current urban layout, land use, and infrastructure, as well as planned expansions and areas available for future commercial development. To achieve this, the maps must feature a custom color scheme and layout, accurate symbolization and labeling of polygons and line features, and additional elements to enhance map quality.
